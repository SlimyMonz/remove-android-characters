Open the file and modify settings, specifically the PATH and CHARACTERS as-needed. 

Currently, the directory is set default to $HOME. Make sure to change this or it will rename EVERY FILE AND FOLDER in your Home directory. 

Make sure to Chmod +X the file

Open a bash terminal window in the directory of the script.

On Linux in the terminal: chmod +x remove_android_chars.sh

Run with ./remove_android_chars.sh

Note: Run more than once just in case. Sometimes subdirectories do not get renamed.
